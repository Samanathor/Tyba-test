"This is a test for the company Tyba.

Getting Started
The application was created using the Dart language and Visual Studio Code extensions. In addition, the Material interface from the official Flutter documentation was implemented to optimize the use of Widgets. I also used other libraries such as:

Firebase
Geolocator
http / Flutter
Shared Preferences
Flutter Typeahead
It includes the specified GPS bonus, which works with iOS, and I used Firebase to store the necessary data. If you test the GPS functionality using the VS Code debugger and the simulator, it is recommended to set the latitude and longitude of the virtual device to a central city for proper operation."
